    <heading><activity>Molding and shrinking</activity> a large shape</heading>

    <block purpose="making"> Mold it with the <material>pith of bread</material> just out of the
        oven, or like that aforementioned, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently so
        will the <keyword>medal</keyword> that you will cast. By these means - lengthening out or
        enlarging the imprinted <material>bread</material> - you can vary the shape &amp; from one
        face make several different ones. The bread straight from the oven is best. And the one
        which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast <material>sulfur</material> without
        letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you
        want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent. </block>
