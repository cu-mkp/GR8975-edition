    <heading><activity>Casting</activity> with lead and tin</heading>

    <block purpose="making">
        <activity> The way I have done it <!-- casting --> for lizards and serpents is with two ℥ of
            pure <material>tin</material> for one lb. of unrefined <material>lead</material> that is
            impure.</activity> The mold is made out of the aforementioned sand, common for all
        metals, when it is reheated, leave it to cool until you can put your finger in it without
        causing a breach in the gate of the cast. As for the <material>lead</material>, it is melted
        in a <tool>crucible</tool> with a bellows' fire until both the crucible and the lead are
        red. When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with <material>charcoal</material> or with
        a specially made <tool>scraper</tool> or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done,
        leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a
        bit of <material>resin</material> to burn away the filth. However, some think it best not to
        put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to
        also thrown in a bean-size quantity of <material>bismuth</material> for each pound of
            <material>lead</material>. And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the
        mold. If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a <tool>press</tool> so that they
        join well and so that the <material>lead</material> does not come out of the mold. However,
        should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up,
        cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other
        one and will come out very neatly like the main one. The same thing can be said for pure
            <material>tin</material> used for thin things. And that way for doing pure
            <material>tin</material> is one ℥ of new <material>lead</material> for one lb. of the
        former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between <tool>two layers of
            copper</tool>, and then bury the whole thing in sand, which is better than ashes,
        because being heavy, it will seal better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because
        the metal is heavy. Some make square molds </block>

    <!-- apart from having marginalia as related blocks we also have related folios when the body of one entry moves to the next folio as below;
When we use <realted-block> across folios it disrupts the positionality of marginalia if they lose their position, especially at the top of the page, where would they be placed in the consolidated entry? I am assuming that we are trying to have a continous entry without pagebreaks

    <block>are made of earth or blades of copper, or iron, or wood covered with white iron, in order
        to bury more easily these aforementioned molds between the thin <tool>sheets of copper,
            estric or one of iron</tool>. </block>

    <block position="left-top" purpose="making"> When the metal is thick, you do not need to cast as
        hot as when it is thin. </block>
    <!--the marginalia above and below can be classified as making or advice; however making seems to be more applicable since the block is giving adice for making; this makes me wonder if purpose can be defined at the entry level; of course, there are time when purpose has to be defined at the block level-->
    <block position="top" purpose="making"> When you melt this often, it becomes sour and fragile
        because it has to be cast very hot and it makes it half-calicanated. Use new stuff. </block>

    <block position="left-top" purpose="making"> Note that If you want to cast with cuttlefish bone,
        they cannot be too warm because that would burn the cuttefish. For this effect, try
            <material>paper</material>. It it becomes brown, it is enough, and it is good for
        casting, but if it blackens the paper, then it is too hot. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom" purpose="making"> If you want to cast <material>paper</material>
        with writing on it, make a mixture with half lead and half tin. As soon as it is melted,
        throw it between two pieces of cardboard on a flat place that is level. And with a point or
        gold or hard wood, engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having poured the lead
        onto the cardboard, press onto it the other piece of cardboard. </block>
