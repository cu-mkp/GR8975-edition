##  Gilding wood 

 
First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear glue; and when it is dry, you will apply a coat of yellow gold; and when this is done you will take fig tree wood and soak it for a while, and wash the place you want to gild,dhdjhjdhdjh and cut your gold with a knife near where you will put it; and said gold must be applied with cotton, and if you can find some fig tree, take an egg white and stir it frequently.
 
If your gold does not have a nice enough color, you will take a partridge feather burn it in a chafing—dish, and turn the smoke toward what you have gilded.
