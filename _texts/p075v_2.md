##  <span class="material">Gilding wood</span> 

 
First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear <span class="material">glue</span>; and when it is dry, you will apply a coat of yellow <span class="material">gold</span>; and when this is done you will take <span class="material">fig tree wood</span> and soak it for a while, and wash the place you want to gild,dhdjhjdhdjh and cut your gold with a <span class="tool">knife</span> near where you will put it; and said gold must be applied with <span class="tool">cotton</span>, and if you can find some fig tree, take an <span class="material">egg white</span> and stir it frequently.
 
If your gold does not have a nice enough color, you will take a <span class="material">partridge feather</span> burn it in a <span class="tool">chafing—dish</span>, and turn the smoke toward what you have gilded.
