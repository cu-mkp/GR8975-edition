## Founder

 
The <span class="tool">clay mould</span> should be baked until sometimes it becomes red hot, since otherwise the <span class="material">metal</span> would be unstable and be no good at all. Similarly, the inner core must be baked very hard, and mixed with <span class="material">charcoal powder</span>.
