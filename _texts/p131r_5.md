## Molded wax

 
 <span class="material">Wax</span> representations made from <span class="material">white lead</span> and <span class="material">cerussite</span> are not made to be burned and melted in a mold where you want to cast <span class="material">silver</span> and <span class="material">gold</span>; this would make it brittle. Moreover if you use such a mold, the <span class="material">wax</span> would be stripped thanks to the violence of the fire which makes it boil, and the mixture made of <span class="material">cerrusite</span> or any other metal would attack the mold. That's why if you want to sketch things

 to be cast with <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span>. Do not add to your wax all the drugs you are preparing, but only melted <span class="material">sulphur</span>, as the candle melts, and also candle smoke. Melted <span class="material">sulphur</span> falls down to the bottom of your mold, but lets the wax keeps some of its quality, melting it but leaving it a little firm. You can thus melt your wax representation on fire. If your <span class="material">wax</span> is composed of <span class="material">cerussite</span> or something similar, you need to put your mold into boiling water.
