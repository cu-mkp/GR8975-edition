## Imitation diamonds set into the work 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 Spread a fine layer of imprinting <span class="material">black wax</span> on the inside of the frame then coat it inside with <span class="material">wheat oil</span>, then dust it with lamp smoke because this color should not be lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of <span class="material">wax</span> then, with a <span class="tool">steel point</span>, or a small <span class="tool">finishing hammer</span>, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.
