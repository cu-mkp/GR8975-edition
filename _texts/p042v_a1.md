## Pounce for scratching satin

 
After pouncing with <span class="material">crushed flour</span> or <span class="material">chalk</span>, in order that the dots of the pounce not be erased, go over the trace with <span class="material">egg white</span> beaten with the <span class="material">milk or bark of a fig tree</span>, which will immediately make the egg white clear up like water, without becoming opaque, it will maintain the trace that you will go over again and scratch with a <span class="tool">piece of glass</span> or <span class="tool">penknife</span>.
