## For molding thinly 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 After you have molded the first mold as the core, leave it to dry well before removing the figure from <span class="material">wax</span>, so that the mold is not ruined. Afterwards, then make make a small lasagna of paste as thick as you like, and, once you have greased the cavity of your first hollowed mold with <span class="material">butter</span>, apply the paste to it [the cavity of the first concave mold] and then the upper part of the second mold. If you grease [the mold] with <span class="material">oil</span>, it will be soaked up [into the mold] and it will not be as clean as <span class="material">butter</span>.
