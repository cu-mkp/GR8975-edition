## Dyes from flowers

 
Red poppies that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The boufain makes a very beautiful blue. An herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet flower verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys, makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure. Another columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that of the pansy, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.
