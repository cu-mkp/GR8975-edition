## Dyes from flowers

 
<span class="plant">Red poppies</span> that grow amongst <span class="plant">wheat</span> make a very beautiful columbine on white <span class="material">leather</span>. The <span class="material">boufain</span> makes a very beautiful blue. An <span class="plant">herb</span> which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to <span class="plant">flax</span>, long and broad leaves like little <span class="plant">bugloss</span>, which has a violet <span class="plant">flower</span> verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys, makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure. Another columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that of the <span class="plant">pansy</span>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.
