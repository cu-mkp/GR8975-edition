## <span class="material">Sand</span>, for the most excellent <span class="material">lead</span> of all, for large and small reliefs

   I took white <span class="material">lead</span> and crushed it dry on <span class="tool">porphyry</span>, to make it very fine. Then I moistened it a lot with very well beaten <span class="material">egg white</span>, so that it became like a paste, by making it stick together perfectly with the <span class="tool">flat of a knife</span>. I let it rest for a while.   X    Mix it well with the <span class="tool">knife</span>  <div class="folio" align="center">- - - - - <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f175.image" target="_blank"><img src="https://cu-mkp.github.io/GR8975-edition/assets/photo-icon.png" alt="folio image: " style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-3px;"/>085r</a> - - - - - </div>   and place it on a flat well—clean <span class="tool">table</span>, and since it has a desiccative quality, I knew it would dry out. I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder and mold it with sand, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers and the sharp side of a <span class="tool">knife</span>. I oiled my medal because <span class="material">oil</span> cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning and drying the medal with a <span class="tool">cloth</span> and small <span class="tool">bristle brush of <span class="material">pork skin</span></span>, I lightly oiled it once more with clear <span class="material">walnut oil</span>, and gently swiped it with a <span class="tool">cloth</span> so that [the medal] would not be too oiled; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the <span class="material">white lead</span>, wet with <span class="material">glair</span>, which would not damage the oil. This worked very well. I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good sands such as felt, <span class="material">burnt bone</span>, and <span class="material">iron dross</span> failed to do on the first attempt. I re—cooked it and my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that sands used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of water, which gives body and firmness, like <span class="material">egg white</span>, <span class="material">gummed water</span>, [or] one [water] boiled with <span class="material">elm root</span>. And lightly oil your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass. But <span class="material">soft lead</span> and <span class="material">sour tin</span> must be cast at a very hot temperature.    Since that moment, I have realized that even though this sand is excellent, can be cast often and molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the <span class="material">soft lead</span> does not suit the mold well. But I have tried to mix it with <span class="material">lean sand</span>, such as <span class="material">pumice</span>, <span class="material">metal scrapings</span>, and similar things, in order to give it body, and to help it come off easily, because lean sand [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes metal well.    Try to mix <span class="material">white lead</span> or <span class="material">minium</span> with other sands.   X    Oil and smear with <span class="material">aspic oil</span>, which will disappear when reheated, because the oil causes bubbling.    It is necessary to mold with <span class="material">egg white</span>, and then mix it well. And once it is in the <span class="tool">box mold</span>, beat it well on the top with a <span class="tool">pestle</span>, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.    It is best to fill the <span class="tool">box mold</span> in one go, because the mixture made of several sands, and the one from mines, that you use to fill the <span class="tool">box mold</span>, damages it.
