## Pewtermaker

 
They mix viii or ten pounds of <span class="material">lead</span> for each hundredweight of <span class="material">tin</span> in the cities that have regulated guilds. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii. lb. of <span class="material">estaim de glace</span> to bind it and three lb. of broken <span class="material"> brass</span>, that is, <span class="material">copper</span> scrap that kettlemakers make. This makes the <span class="tool">vessel</span> more reverberant and it is not as breakable.
