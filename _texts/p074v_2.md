## To make yellow varnish

 
Take some gum arabic and let it soak in water, then take some well beaten saffran and soak said gum. And make it quite light, then make your ground layer on that which you want to varnish, and leave it to dry, and when it will be dry give another ground layer of the same varnish, and leave it to dry as before, until it will be dry enough. Then take varnish from an apothecary, crushed by strokes far enough from one another. Then wash your hands quite well and spread your varnish with their palms.
