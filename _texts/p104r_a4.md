## How to <span class="material">silver</span> plate <span class="material">copper</span> and <span class="material">latten</span>

 
<span class="activity"></span>Mold the <span class="material">silver</span> as the <span class="material">gold</span>, and put it in the <span class="tool">oven</span> in order to get a good gilt pot. And do not let it heat, otherwise the <span class="material">silver</span> would tarnish. Once it will be well spread, make it boil in <span class="material">walnut oil</span>, and then heat it a bit, and put it [into the <span class="material">water</span> the <span class="profession">silversmiths</span> use to bleach their works].
