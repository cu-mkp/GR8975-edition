This, wet & well beat & kneaded as you know, is necessary for you to make the contour of your molds. But attend that it not be too soft. But likewise [attend that it be] sort of half dry such that it doesn't attack the hands at all, because otherwise it would attack your work. Always keep it in a damp place, and make some holes in it, and fill them with <span class="material">water</span>, to keep it fresh.
