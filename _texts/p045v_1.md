## Loading an arquebus

 
You must have different charges depending to the range that you want your <span class="tool">arquebus</span> to have, all of which have a screw on the end that fits in the nut of the the said arquebus' <span class="tool">ramrod</span>. So when you put the <span class="material">powder</span>powder in the charge, which is in the <span class="tool">nut</span>, hold the ramrod upright. And raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is in the bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the barrel up, and remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be entirely in the breech without any grain or dust that lines the sides of the arquebus, which always has some grime in the chamber. That way it will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.
