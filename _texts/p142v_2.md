## Molds

   <span class="activity"></span> 
Make some notches in them the molds that enter more into the inside of the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength. Take care to keep from reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break.

>  Do not keep them molds in a humid place, nor an enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold. The same with dried animals. 
 
> *at left middle  margin of folio 142v*

>  It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do <span class="animal">toads</span>, which can very well be molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once.
