## The Work done in Algiers

 
Have a <span class="animal">colt</span> of three of four years and feed it on <span class="material">barley</span> and <span class="material">straw</span> cut in the same way as that which they use to feed horses in <span class="place">Spain</span>. Let it drink <span class="material">water</span> from a good fountain or river <span class="material">water</span>. I do not know if it would be good sometimes to let him drink the <span class="material">water</span> of <span class="material">sulfur</span> springs, and to sometimes give him <span class="material">fenugreek</span> or other hot foods, for the intention of the worker is to use the heat of his <span class="material">manure</span>, and the climate here is cooler than that of Algiers. Keep it in a warm place and use it and make sure it loses none of its <span class="material">manure</span> or <span class="material">urine</span>, of which you will make a mass or two so that while one cools the other will keep its heat and be suitable to continue. Also have a large flask as thick as possible, one finger thick if it can be so made, and with a capacity of one pitcher or <span class="material">clay</span> jug, and around the feast of St John place a dozen and a half <span class="material">chicken eggs</span>, that is to say, the <span class="material">egg</span> without the <span class="material">egg white</span> and the <span class="material">germ</span>. Others say sixty <span class="material">yolks</span>. And with this dozen and a half of <span class="material">chicken egg yolks</span> put one half ounce (others say sixty <span class="material">eggs</span> and a half pound) of <span class="material">female silk worm eggs</span>. And after carefully luting the flask (I do not know if air will be needed for the generation) and bury it in the heat of the <span class="material">manure</span> up to the neck, and leave it there until several <span class="animal">worms</span> are engendered and then remove the flask and do not bury it in the <span class="material">manure</span> anymore. But put it on the hot layer of the <span class="material">manure</span> until all the <span class="animal">worms</span> are eaten and consume one another by shriveling and stirring, and only one remains. Once this has happened, you must lure it at regular intervals, day and night, with the assistance of two men, who will care for it in shifts, and you will lure it with an <span class="material">egg yolk</span> covered in <span class="material">gold</span> leaf or with a liquid <span class="material">yolk</span> into which the <span class="material">gold</span> leaf has been incorporated. And be careful that it does not miss such fodder (some say one <span class="material">egg yolk</span> per hour, others say three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the practice). So nourished in this way it will grow in two month or seven weeks and will become like a <span class="animal">serpent</span>, one span and four fingers long, and one pound in weight, and as the wings will begin to develop, you must kill it, doing so with a <span class="material">charcoal</span> fire in a ring around the bottle one span away from it, and at that time lute the bottle well so that it does not exhale.

or to be safer, go away until the fire is completely blown out and that everything is cold again. Because the exaltation may be dangerous. And for that moment, when you take it with some tongs, do cover your mouth with some good <span class="material">vinegar</span> and have a protection and cover yourself with it. Once it has died out, put it into a cloth or a canvas made of <span class="material">silk</span> and fold it and hold it to a board exposed to air and the sun will dry it. Once it is well dry, powder it in a mortar and keep this powder cautiously Because one ounce of this one thrown on 3 pounds of melted <span class="material">♁</span> transforms it into a finer <span class="material">☉</span> than the other one. But there is not so much pitch. You also have to choose the oldest <span class="material">♁</span> possible which has often melted before and finely hammered into blades or other works, and at first purify it by melting and throwing it into some <span class="material">honey</span> and <span class="material">vinegar</span>. The completion time for such work is nine months from Saint John's day until the 25th April.
