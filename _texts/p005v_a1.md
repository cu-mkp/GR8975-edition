## For bronzing in yellow and white

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Take <span class="material_format">mirror <span class="material">tin</span></span> and melt it. On <span class="unit">half a pound</span> of this, put <span class="unit">half an ounce</span> of <span class="material">quicksilver</span>, and remove it immediately from the <span class="tool">fire</span> and grind it until it is <span class="unit">like ashes</span>. Wash it thoroughly in <span class="material_format">clean <span class="material">water</span></span>, then grind it on a <span class="tool"><span class="material_format"><span class="material">marble</span> slab</span></span> and soak it with <span class="material">water</span> of <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle de retailles</span></span>. Then apply that on your <span class="material">wood</span>en candlesticks and any other works you like, and burnish with a <span class="tool">tooth</span>. You can grind <span class="material">pin filings</span> and apply them with the said <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle de retailles</span></span>.
