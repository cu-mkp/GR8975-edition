## Glassmaker's black

 
Filings of <span class="material">iron</span> taken from bars that have been in the fire for a long time, which are thick, are much better than the common soft ones that fall under the <span class="tool">anvil</span> in the <span class="tool">forge</span>, because they imitate niello. To said black, described elsewhere, some people add a little <span class="material">minium</span>.
