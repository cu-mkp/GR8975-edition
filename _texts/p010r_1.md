## Imitation <span class="material">jasper</span>

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  Take <span class="material">horn</span> as is used to make lanterns, quite thin, and underneath imitate your <span class="material">jasper</span>, <span class="material">cornaline</span>, and other stones. That will look more appropriate than doing it on <span class="material">glass</span>, which is too shiny. And the <span class="material">horn</span> gives a lustre and a fatty polish similar to <span class="material">jasper</span>. 
 
 <span class="activity"></span>   You know how you can imitate <span class="plant">roses</span> with scrapings of the said <span class="material">horn</span>. The colors for this <span class="material">jasper</span> need to have as a base <span class="material_format">clear <span class="material">turpentine</span></span> or <span class="material_format"><span class="material">spike lavender</span> varnish</span>. And matte, opaque colors are not appropriate, no matter how fine they are. You have to <span class="material">oil</span> the unpainted underside with <span class="material">spike lavender oil</span>.

  <span class="material_format">Thin <span class="material">glass</span></span> looks very fine for this effect

 <span class="activity"></span> You can inlay beds with it, and on the joints you can throw <span class="material">talc</span> or <span class="material_format"><span class="material">metal</span> filings</span> on the fresh <span class="material">cement</span> of the said joints. You have to bond them with <span class="material">gum amoniacum</span> soaked in <span class="material">vinegar</span>. To better imitate <span class="material_format">marbled <span class="material">jasper</span></span>, apply <span class="material_format">coarse <span class="material">wool</span> hair</span> dyed various colors and intermingled. After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines into them then lay down <span class="material_format"><span class="material">gold</span> leaves</span> and <span class="material_format"><span class="material">silver</span> leaves</span>. If you lay down colors made of <span class="material">turpentine</span> on the <span class="material">horn</span>, give it a backing of <span class="material_format"><span class="material">silver</span> leaf</span>or of <span class="material_format"><span class="material">tin</span> leaf</span>. You can also file <span class="material">horn</span> and mix it with strong <span class="material">glue</span> and lay it down onto the joints of the <span class="material">horn</span> piece and finish with a <span class="tool">joiner's plane</span>.
