## Spinet playing by itself

 
<span class="activity"></span>Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around in their thickness and attach <span class="material">feathers</span> as for a cittern or a spinet and arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a <span class="tool">clock spring</span>, your invention will effect itself.
