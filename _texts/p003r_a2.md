## <span class="material">Varnish</span> for paintings

 <span class="activity"></span>  
 Take a <span class="unit">pound</span> of <span class="material">Venice turpentine</span> and heat it in a <span class="tool">pot</span> until it simmers, put in half a <span class="unit">pound</span> of the <span class="material_format"><span class="material">whitest turpentine oil</span> you can find</span> and stir all together well on a <span class="tool">charcoal fire</span> and take it off immediately after, and it is done. But if you find it too thick, add more <span class="material">oil</span>, whereas if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <span class="material">turpentine</span>. And so you will give it whatever consistency you want. It could be made without <span class="tool">fire</span>, but it is more desiccative when heated. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things, without distorting the colors or yellowing, and dries both in the shade and under the sun, overnight, and during the summer as well as in the winter. It is usually sold 15 sols a <span class="unit">pound</span>.

> You need a little more <span class="material">turpentine</span> than <span class="material">turpentine oil</span> to thicken the <span class="material">varnish</span>, which you need to apply with your finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick because when it is thick, it turns yellow and gathers [together]. <span class="material">Varnish</span> is not used to make paintings shine, because it just takes the light out of them.
