## Perfume—makers

 
T<span class="activity">hey readily make their perfumes with <span class="material">half amber</span> and <span class="material">half musk</span>, and a <span class="material">little civet</span>, because the scent of <span class="material">amber</span> is stronger than the scent of <span class="material">musk</span>.</span>
 
To save using amber, <span class="profession">perfume—makers</span> readily add add a <span class="unit">small quantity</span> of <span class="material">musk</span> to the white layers, in order to get a stronger scent. But to remove or hide the blackness of musk, they add a bit of <span class="material">starch from England</span>, which is perfectly white.
 
To give off a scent of white amber, in the same way that the <span class="name">Portuguese</span> do, take a <span class="material">chunk of amber</span> that you have broken up into pieces. Having put in a small <span class="tool">silver porringer</span> a <span class="unit">spoon</span> of <span class="material">flower oil</span>, should you not have some, <span class="material">linseed oil</span>. That is to say, use the type of <span class="tool">silver spoon</span> one might use at the table. Pour into this your <span class="material">ambergris</span>, then place it on a low fire, it will melt quickly if your <span class="material">amber</span> is of good quality, and there will be no lumps. Having melted it all, put in a small bit of civet, and melt it all and blend it well together. Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and lightly dip the <span class="tool">edge of your finger</span> around the edge of the oil, with patience slowly spread the oil along the glove, and rub the glove between your <span class="tool">hands</span> and trace along the fingers and its stitches, one after the other. Leave it to dry. Then repeat the previous procedure until you have used up all of the <span class="material">amber</span>.
