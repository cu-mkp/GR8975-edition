## Ears

 
When a defluxion occurs in the ear, be very careful not to put anything in it, and following the proverb, ears and eyes should only be touched with your elbow. However, to an affected ear, it is good to apply <span class="material_format">musky <span class="material">cotton</span></span>, that is to say, <span class="material">cotton</span> kept in <span class="material">musk</span>, which comforts quite well.
