## Vinegar

 
One takes for granted that jec heat red—hot the mineral salt that looks like marble & that is called in Catalonia & at the border of Spain Cardona salt, & throwing it in the red hot or quite hot in wine, it turns it into very good vinegar. Some make it with water poured on pomace soured after being pressed by grape pickers, but it will not keep & spoils in heat & thunder storms.
