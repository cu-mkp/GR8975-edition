## Improving the color of gold

 
Put some <span class="material">aqua fortis</span> made with <span class="material">vitriol</span> on <span class="tool">hot embers</span>. Cover the bottle, that is, the vent, with a tile. Then uncover it and a thick smoke will come out in which you put the <span class="material">gold</span> and it will take on an excellent color.
