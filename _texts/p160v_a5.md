## Catching birds

 
During winter, when <span class="animal">birds</span> have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your <span class="animal">birds</span> on <span class="material">trees</span>, have some [look like they are] singing, [look like they have assembled] and are numerous.
 
the <span class="tool">oven</span> must not be too hot. This [method] is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they [birds] could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.
