## <span class="animal">Nightingale</span>

 
<span class="activity"></span>The <span class="material">iron</span> wire used for its cage must be the thickest possible, so that should it try to leave, it will not hurt itself. At the beginning of its captivity cover its cage in <span class="material">fabric</span>. The first day you will have to forcibly feed it, moving it from its cage in your hand and opening its beak and with a small <span class="tool">wooden needle</span>, place its food in its throat and make it swallow. And continue to do so until it is no longer willful. You must do this to keep it alive, because should it become thin or lose weight it will die.
