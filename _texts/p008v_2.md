 You have to calcine your <span class="material_format">pure <span class="material">gold</span></span> with <span class="material">☿</span> and then let your amalgam dry well and the said <span class="material">mercury</span> fly off. Then crush it on <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span> with <span class="material_format">gummed <span class="material">water</span></span>. As for <span class="material">silver</span> you have to use it in its raw form and corrode it with <span class="material"><span class="foreign">aqua fortis</span></span>, then take it out with a <span class="tool"><span class="material">copper</span> blade</span> and rinse it well and then grind it with <span class="material_format">gum <span class="material">water</span></span>.
