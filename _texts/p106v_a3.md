Keep reheated <span class="material">plaster</span>, as is said here, one or two <span class="time">months</span> well compacted in a dry place, if it's not the rainy season but rather fresh out it is more excellent for exquisite work.

The hardest <span class="material">plaster</span>, as was said, is the best, being taken thusly totally raw from <span class="material">stones</span> of this kind. Crush it as finely as possible and pass it through the most fine <span class="tool">sieve</span> or <span class="tool">sleeve</span> that you can. Having been made fine in this way, put a good amount in a <span class="tool">cauldron</span> or <span class="tool">frying pan</span> over an open flame. & as it starts to heat up, stir it continuously. And heavy and lumpy though it is, it will become so light and so tractable that it will appear to you not to have any resistance to the said stirring, as though it were of <span class="material">water</span>. Continue to keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy and thick. And now this is the sign that it is cooked, but do not reheat it at all such that your <span class="material">stone alum brick</span> be reheated & that clay circles form. Because this must be the last reheating, and when everything else is ready, because the less that the <span class="material">plaster</span> remains reheated & the more suddenly it is put into the work, the better, because it takes rather better. It is not permitted to reheat it except when you want to mold. And to reheat it, put it, in fine, totally raw powder, in a <span class="tool">cauldron</span> on a clear flame & do not give it too much [heat] in one go nor too fierce. Stir continuously with a long <span class="tool">stick</span>, turning around the <span class="tool">cauldron</span> to avoid the vapor. And in the middle, in the form of a figure 8 at the beginning, you will find it heavy [and] clayey because it is full of moisture, [and] when it heats up, it will start to throw off [the moisture] in some bubbles on the edges of the <span class="tool">cauldron</span>. And finally it will become liquid & mealy and like bran and start boiling in the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy ʘʘ

as heavy as before, and it should be like a paste not very thick, it must not be as easy to stir as a liquid. This state shows you that it is cooked enough. It must boil in the middle, and all around you must have a thick mixture. If you reheat it too much your mixture would be short of body, because if it becomes red the mixture will lose its strength and it will spoil the sand. Let it cool before mixing it to any other <span class="material">sand</span>. […]
