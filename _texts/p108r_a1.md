## Spalt

 
 <span class="material">Spalt</span> is white like <span class="material">cooked plaster</span> and one can find it in mounds and <span class="material">stones</span> made in long stairs and long veins. It is very soft such that with a fingernail and it makes a powder like that of our <span class="material">chalk from Champagne</span>. And because everything which is provided from the earth is mixed with some other substance, to purify it [the spalt], one boils it with somewhat large <span class="material">gemstones</span> then tempers it with <span class="material">essence of sal ammoniac</span>. One puts [a lump of it] <span class="unit">the size of a walnut</span> in a large <span class="tool">bottle</span> of <span class="material">water</span> and that way one tempers it & reducing it into small balls, [one] purges it of impurities [by] then putting it on to cook cleanly in a <span class="tool">vessel of earth[enware]</span> in a <span class="tool">furnace</span> like those in which <span class="tool">pots</span> [are made] and one leaves it there to the point at which <span class="tool">pots</span> would be fired. After one tempers it more with <span class="material">essence of sal ammoniac</span> & boiling it very strongly and emptying the <span class="material">murky water</span> & putting it in a separate <span class="tool">vessel</span> straight after put back the same <span class="material">water</span> over it & one boils & one puts back the <span class="material">murky water</span> again with the other. And one does this therefore until that which is there has passed away. In this way one purges and purifies and makes it a very fine and malleable [matter]. After one has taken away the <span class="material">water</span> by tilting [it] or with a <span class="tool">sponge</span>, one takes the residue and dries it. Then moistening it with the aforementioned <span class="material">water</span> the way one did with the other <span class="material">sand</span>, one uses it in a <span class="tool">frame</span> or if it shrinks [this] is a sign that it is not fired enough & needs to be fired more. This one is proper for molding all <span class="material">metal</span> and especially <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span> and the more it is used the better it is. One should put <span class="material">alum</span> which you have cast of <span class="material">lead</span> or <span class="material">tin</span> separately because it makes <span class="material">gold</span>. sour if you cast it there.
