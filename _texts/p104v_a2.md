## For casting

 
<span class="activity"></span>If you've got a big piece which does not allow an easy stripping of casting, mold it with some wax, either on the hollow side or in relief, because it is soft and hollow and so can easily be separated from the piece without leaving anything. But be sure that the melted <span class="material">wax</span> is neither too hot nor too cold. Some people use for molding some <span class="material">wax</span> warmed in boiled <span class="material">water</span>, but while pressing the mold it bends and becomes unusable. Once you have made your <span class="material">wax</span> cavity, you can cast in some very soft and clear <span class="material">clay</span>, and let it dry. Then, upon it you will make a <span class="material">lead</span> or <span class="material">tin</span> cavity, in which what you will make will easily be stripped.
