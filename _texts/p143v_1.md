## Openwork carcanets 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 You can mold them "en <span class="material">noyau</span>" like <span class="animal">crayfish</span>, first with one side being made higher with <span class="material">clay</span>, which is hollow, and then you open it from the other side and make the second casting. You can just as well cast them "en chassis", provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in <span class="material">wax</span>, or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with <span class="material">wax</span> or <span class="material">clay</span>.
