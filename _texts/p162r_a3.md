## Rotten wood

 
<span class="activity"><span class="material">Wood</span> that is white, being <span class="unit">light as a sponge</span>, if burnt in a close fire, may be used for casting lead in a box and molds very cleanly, but these things [such material] do not withstand [open?] fire.</span>
