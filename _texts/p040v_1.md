## Cross of the commanders of Malta

 
The fine rouge <span class="material">clair</span> which is the background of the white enamel cross is of fine <span class="material">dragon's blood</span> drops soaked with <span class="material">eau de vie</span> or <span class="material">Indian laque plate</span>, which I believe is made in <span class="place">Flanders</span>, distempered with clear <span class="material">turpentine</span> and <span class="material">mastic</span> drops and applied on a <span class="material">silver leaf</span>, not the one used by painters but a thicker one, which is burnished by the makers of foil backings for <span class="material">gemstones</span> or by goldsmiths, and that gives it its fine brilliance.
