## Leaded silver

 
A lot of <span class="material">silver</span> is wasted because of the lead which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the charcoal which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt <span class="material">silver coins</span>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting lizards or animals, for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, <span class="material">silver viper</span>, like in the first recipe above. And at the end of the line of <span class="material">4 reals (of 20 S of Spain)</span>, and <span class="material">one coin of 20 S from France</span>.
