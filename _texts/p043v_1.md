## Varied and transmuted wine

 
Grate <span class="material">Brazilwood</span> very fine, let it soak for one or two hours in clear <span class="material">water</span>. Then take this tinted water and add some clear water and you will make wine as clear as you like. If you please, put a drop of <span class="material">juice of lemon</span> or of <span class="material">orange</span> in it and it will immediately become white. You can drink it without danger.
