## To lay down and set <span class="material_format">burnished <span class="material">gold</span></span> and give it a red or green or blue hue

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span> <span class="material">Ceruse</span> and <span class="material_format"><span class="material">lead</span> white</span> is not appropriate for polished white nor for burnishing because it is fat, but it is quite good for <span class="material_format">matte <span class="material">gold</span></span>, which is made with <span class="material">oil</span> by mixing it with <span class="material">yellow ochre</span> and <span class="material">mine</span> and tempering the whole with <span class="material">oil</span>, and this <span class="material_format">matte <span class="material">gold</span></span> so applied lasts in the rain, like gilded leadwork and similar things. Therefore, for <span class="material_format">burnished <span class="material">gold</span></span> take <span class="material_format">good <span class="material">chalk</span>, quite white, well ground</span> and soaked with <span class="material">distemper glue</span> and do <span class="unit">four</span> coats of it, one after the other, on the <span class="material">wood</span>. And when the last one is dry, rub it with <span class="tool"><span class="plant">prêle</span></span>, which is a kind of grass otherwise named <span class="tool"><span class="plant">horsetail</span></span>, to render it well polished. Afterwards, take <span class="material_format">fine <span class="material"><span class="place">Armenian</span> bole</span></span> and <span class="material">sanguine</span>, <span class="unit">as much of one as of the other</span>, a bit of <span class="material"><span class="animal">lamb</span> tallow</span> <span class="unit">the size of a bean or a pea</span> depending on the quantity of <span class="material">bole</span>, and <span class="unit">a little</span> <span class="material"><span class="plant">willow</span> charcoal</span>, or <span class="unit">as much as</span> the <span class="material">tallow</span>, and <span class="unit">half a walnut shell</span> filled with <span class="material_format">half—burned <span class="material">saffron</span></span>; some put in <span class="unit">a little</span> <span class="material">candi sugar</span>. Grind everything together with <span class="material">water</span> and apply it without <span class="material">gum</span> or <span class="material">glue</span>, and let it dry. And rub the place that you would like to gild with a piece of <span class="tool">white cloth</span> to better unify it, and when the rubbed place is a little shiny it is a sign that the <span class="material">gold</span> will behave well. After rubbing, wash the place that you want to gild with <span class="tool">a clean brush</span> soaked with <span class="material_format">clear <span class="material">water</span></span> and apply the <span class="material">gold</span> at once, which you will burnish when dry. And if you want to set <span class="material"><span class="foreign">rouge clair</span></span> and glaze with it, grind <span class="material"><span class="place">Venice</span> lake</span> on the <span class="tool"><span class="material">marble</span></span> with <span class="material">walnut oil</span> or <span class="material">linseed oil</span>. After grinding, mix in <span class="material_format"><span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span> or <span class="material_format"><span class="material">spike lavender</span> varnish</span> and apply on <span class="material">gold</span> with the <span class="tool">brush</span>. <span class="material">Brazilwood</span> and <span class="material"><span class="foreign">laque ronde</span></span> fade. For green, temper <span class="material">verdigris</span> with <span class="material">walnut oil</span> or <span class="material">linseed oil</span> and grind it, then mix in some <span class="material_format"><span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span>; not <span class="material_format"><span class="material">aspic</span> varnish</span>, which is not suitable for <span class="material">verdigris</span>. If you want to glaze with <span class="material">azure</span> it must be set on <span class="material_format">burnished <span class="material">silver</span></span>. Take <span class="material">azure enamel</span>, and without grinding temper it with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span> and apply it.
