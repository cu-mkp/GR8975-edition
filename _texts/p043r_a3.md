## Purpurine

 
Take half an ounce of soft <span class="material">tin</span>, melt it in a <span class="tool">spoon</span>. Once it is melted, throw in an ℥ of ☿, mix together. Once they are cold, grind on a <span class="tool">porphyry slab</span>. Then take an ℥ of <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span> and an ℥ of the yellowest <span class="material">sulfur</span> that may be found, grind both. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Then put all together into a <span class="tool">glass sublimatorium</span>. Hold this over a small fire for an hour, and for an hour over a stronger fire, and for an hour over a very strong fire, and it will be ready. Then, to use it, apply <span class="material">resin</span> black with the <span class="material">glue</span> used by painters to paint, two or three times, until it is quite black. Then apply a bit of <span class="material">varnish</span>. Once it is dry, apply the <span class="material">purpurine</span> dry with a <span class="tool">finger</span> where you want. The more you apply, the finer it will look. Then, if you like, you can apply varnish on top.
