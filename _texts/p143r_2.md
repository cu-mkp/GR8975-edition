##  <span class="profession">Moulders</span> from Foix

 
 Those who mould from across the way make their <span class="material">sand</span> from <span class="material">crocum ferri</span> and <span class="material">calcinated slate</span>, but <span class="material">slate</span> always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a fatty. In the <span class="material">noyau</span>, it is not good; in <span class="material">sand</span>, it can be put to use. They the <span class="profession">moulders</span> from <span class="place">Foix</span> sieve their sand, grind it on porphyry, and soak it in water, and they keep the finest bits which are on the top, then they reheat it.
