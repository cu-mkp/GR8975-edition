## Lights

 
Your brush shows it to you by making some shadow which must always follow the back of your hand, not in a straight line like this,  because the light would be too crude and too harsh, but obliquely and as an incline like this.  It is necessary that the painting is not facing the light, but be half turned back against it, and above all look for a soft light, for it makes a soft shadow and soft work, like a harsh light makes a harsh work.
