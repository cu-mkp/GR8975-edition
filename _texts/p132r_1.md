## Mold made from two casts

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 It opens once anealed. To clean it after, fix the <span class="tool">clamps</span> again, lute the mold, particularly the joints. Then let the earth slowly dry. When it doesn't smoke anymore, let the mold cool down until you can hold it without burning your skin. Then put your molds into the <span class="tool">presses</span>, or into a <span class="tool">pot</span> filled with <span class="material">sand</span>, and cast with <span class="material">tin</span>. If you cast <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span> your mold needs to be cast twice, and cast when your mold becomes red—hot.

> If your heated mold […], shrinks because of the bad quality of the plaster, open it after the first heating, tighten it, then lute it and clamp it again.
