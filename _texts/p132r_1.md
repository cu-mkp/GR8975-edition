## Mold made from two casts

 
 It opens once anealed. To clean it after, fix the <span class="tool">clamps</span> again, lute the mold, particularly the joints. Then let the earth slowly dry. When it doesn't smoke anymore, let the mold cool down until you can hold it without burning your skin. Then put your molds into the <span class="tool">presses</span>, or into a <span class="tool">pot</span> filled with <span class="material">sand</span>, and cast with <span class="material">tin</span>. If you cast <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span> your mold needs to be cast twice, and cast when your mold becomes red—hot.
