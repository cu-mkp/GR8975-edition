## Against the falling sickness

 
Have fresh <span class="material">crow eggs</span>, either four or five, and over the space of four or five mornings cook one, and having mixed in it a bit of powdered <span class="material">gentian</span> and a drop of <span class="material">oil of sulfur</span>, give it to the patient. It is believed that the pain will not return.
