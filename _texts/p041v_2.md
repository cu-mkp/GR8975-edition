## Sheared ewes

 
If the shearer wounds them at some point, he applies the very <span class="material">excrement</span> of the ewe on it. When they are fat, they are easier to shear and do not get hurt as easily.

> If the shearer wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them as [they] are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would cause the sheep to die.
