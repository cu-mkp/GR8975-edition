## Molding and <span class="activity">shrinking</span> a large shape

 
 Mold it with the <span class="material">pith of bread</span> just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, & in drying out it will shrink & consequently so will the medal that you will cast. By these means — lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted <span class="material">bread</span> — you can vary the shape & from one face make several different ones. The <span class="material">bread</span> straight from the oven is best. And the one which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast <span class="material">sulfur</span> without letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.
