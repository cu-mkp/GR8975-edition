## Hard <span class="material">wax</span> to imprint seals

  <span class="activity"></span> 
One makes these [seals] out of white <span class="material">wax</span> which is harder than the other and one mixes in it some <span class="material">cerussite</span> or <span class="material">leaded white</span> very finely ground such that it is as hard as you like and mix in a drop of <span class="material">turpentine</span> to bind it. Afterwards mix it in the color that you want. It is in <span class="material">wax</span> that serves goldsmiths for modeling.
