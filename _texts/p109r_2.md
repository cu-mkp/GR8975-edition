## <span class="material">Wax</span> for molding

 
<span class="activity"></span>Since the <span class="material">wax</span> is molten, they have some <span class="material">sulphur</span> in a <span class="tool">spoon</span> or <span class="tool">crucible</span> and pour it in the molten <span class="material">wax</span>. And with the <span class="material">sulphur</span> going to the bottom or staying on top, it stays where it is and mixes only its substance in the <span class="material">wax</span>, and renders it more meltable when warming it, in such a way that having molded it, the <span class="material">wax</span> gently melts in the mold like <span class="material">butter</span>, without leaving any blister or boil. Also be warned to not give it too much heat.
