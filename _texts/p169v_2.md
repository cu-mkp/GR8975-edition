## Reducing a round form into a hollow one

 
You must firstly mold it with <span class="material">plaster</span> as has been said before, and in the <span class="material">plaster</span> throw in some <span class="material">wax</span> from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure. Then you will <span class="activity">mold</span> this <span class="material">wax relief</span> once more in <span class="material">plaster</span>, or even better with your <span class="material">tempered sand</span>, #, as if for a <span class="material">noyau</span>. And in the latter throw in some lead and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, <span class="activity">repair</span> it on <span class="material">cement</span> or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way, place <span class="material">half of your lead figure which you have oiled</span>, and moisten it with spirits as we have seen above, on your <span class="material">clay base</span>, then <span class="activity">mold</span> this half with a <span class="material">white plaster</span>. Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the <span class="material">plaster</span>, take your <span class="material">black wax mixed with sulphur</span> as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it in <span class="material">hot urine</span>, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your <span class="material">half figure in lead</span>. And you will have a very neat hollow mold. Then adapt your wax hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow wax; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in wax or metal in a <span class="material">noyau</span>. And the <span class="material">noyau</span> mold will give you, whether in <span class="material">silver</span> or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the wax one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the <span class="material">bleach</span>, if it is made of <span class="material">silver</span>, you can put into it some sugar work

Having made a hole in your <span class="material">clay base</span> and having placed there your <span class="material">half figure</span> in <span class="material">wax</span>, oil it a bit so that it comes out more easily.

Transparent wax is not good as opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.

Because you have molded one of your halves with <span class="material">plaster</span> and <span class="material">wax</span>, you can do the same thing to the other half.

<span class="material">perfume</span> and similar things. But be sure that the <span class="material">black wax</span> with which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made harder by adding more <span class="material">melted sulphur</span> in the <span class="material">melted wax</span>, and a bit of <span class="material">resin.</span>
