##  <span class="material_format"><span class="material">Lavender spike oil</span> varnish</span> 

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  One must heat <span class="material">lavender spike oil</span> and, as it begins to simmer, put in <span class="material_format">powdered <span class="material">sandarac gum</span></span> so that it soon melts. And stir continuously over a <span class="tool">charcoal fire</span> until the <span class="material">sandarac</span> is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said varnish on a <span class="tool">plate</span> and, if it is fat enough when you handle it with a <span class="tool">finger</span>, it is ready. And for <span class="unit">one pound</span> of <span class="material">lavender spike oil</span>, you should put <span class="unit">five ounces</span> of <span class="material_format">ground <span class="material">sandarac</span></span>.  Some only put in <span class="unit">four ounces</span> but this is not as good, nor as fat. The former dries promptly. To avoid the trouble of polishing their <span class="material">ebony</span>, <span class="profession">framemakers</span> varnish it with this. So do <span class="profession">guitarmakers</span>. This varnish is not as fitting for paintings as <span class="material_format">fine <span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span>, though it is good for the paintings' moldings. When <span class="material_format"><span class="material">linseed</span> varnish</span> was in use, one would not commonly varnish the landscape of a painting because it would turn the landscape yellow. But with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish</span> one varnishes everywhere. Instead of <span class="material">sandarac</span>, you can add to it <span class="material_format">pulverized <span class="material">mastic</span></span> <span class="unit">drop</span> by <span class="unit">drop</span> or otherwise, and it will dry more quickly.  If you want to varnish <span class="material">plaster</span> or a wall, first put on your <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle de retaille</span></span>, very hot, because if cold it would not penetrate the wall at all. And when you would have put your varnish on, it would come off.

>   <span class="material_format"><span class="material">Aspic oil</span> varnish</span> is not as apt for colors as that of <span class="material">turpentine</span>, because <span class="material">aspic oil</span> eats the colors, since it is too penetrating.
