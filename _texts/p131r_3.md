## Adorning beds, mirrors and similar things

 
 Model any drawing in half relief on a flat slate in order to set it on round or flat things. Cast with very fine <span class="material">tin</span>, then you can gild it with <span class="material">gold leaf</span>, and set it wherever you want. Fill the bottom of the relief with small <span class="material">rubies</span>, <span class="material">orpiment</span>, or any colored little grains.
