## Stucco

 
To stick <span class="material">stones</span>, some do not use <span class="material">gem</span> and pitch black <span class="material">rosin</span> because it is too greasy, but they use as much rosin and <span class="material">sulphur</span> and the same quantity of <span class="material">wax</span> and then add finely ground <span class="material">brick</span>. Others some <span class="material">white chalk</span> and crushed and powdered and sieved <span class="material">white stone</span>.
