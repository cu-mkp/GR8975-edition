## Horsehair sieves

 
They are made often in <span class="place">Normandy</span> with <span class="material">horsetail hairy</span> that they clean with some washing <span class="material">water</span> because they pick them out with their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They do not make the <span class="material">thread</span> longer than the <span class="tool">sieve</span> and it is round. They attach the black or white <span class="material">hair</span> at the two edges of the thread, according to the piece they want to make. And the thread is woven above and below like any other fabric. And passing a small flat <span class="tool">stick</span> of ii or three fingers wide between two, they pass between after two bits of hair at each step strike and weave with three steps. The entire sieve is made of xvii bits of hair. They sell them by dozens and each xxx sols. They bring them to <span class="place">Toulouse</span> to send them then to <span class="place">Spain</span> and there, they exchange it with <span class="material">silk</span>.
