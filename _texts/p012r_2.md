##  <span class="material">Cimolee</span> 

 
 <span class="activity"></span> <span class="activity"></span>  <span class="material">Cimolee</span> or <span class="material"><span class="profession">fullers</span>’ clay</span> (<span class="profession">fullers</span> meaning those who finish <span class="material">cloth</span>) is an excellent material for molding hollow or in relief. If you want to reheat it, it should first be warm and you should reheat gently from a distance, and little by little, otherwise it will crack. To reheat the figure put it in a <span class="tool">pot</span> in an <span class="tool">oven</span>, or in a <span class="tool">closed oven</span>. It comes out very smooth, clean and fine. With <span class="material">cimolee</span> you can make a <span class="tool">hollow mold</span> of an <span class="animal">animal</span> and cast it in <span class="material">lead</span>.

>  <span class="activity"></span> The work needs to have dried for <span class="time">4 or 5 days</span> before you bake it. When you are molding and making a hollow in <span class="material">cimolee</span>, don't press all at once, but gently, or else it would split.
