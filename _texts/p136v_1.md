## <span class="material">latten</span> casting 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 Take <span class="material">latten</span> from <span class="tool">skillet pans</span>, used to make baby's cereal, which is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that <span class="tool">counter</span> from <span class="place">Germany</span> contain a lot of <span class="material">calamine</span>. However, when they are tempered, <span class="material">calamine</span> evaporates, <span class="material">calamine</span> mixed with melted <span class="material">latten</span> always evaporates, because <span class="material">latten</span> becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh <span class="material">calamine</span> and only fresh <span class="material">calamine</span>, which is blended with remelted <span class="material">latten</span>, makes <span class="material">latten</span> run, and allow a clean cast. Because <span class="material">calamine</span> which is added to remelted <span class="material">latten</span> is half—damaged compared with its natural state. This half—damaged <span class="material">calamine</span> make <span class="material">latten</span> porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh <span class="material">calamine</span> to melted <span class="material">latten</span>. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red—hot, like molds to cast <span class="material">gold</span>, <span class="material">silver</span>, <span class="material">copper</span> and metal. If you pour fresh <span class="material">calamine</span>, avoid its smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty <span class="material">counters</span> from <span class="place">Germany</span> and xii <span class="material">clous de rosette</span> made of <span class="material">doulx latton</span>, like for claires medals which are made of soft <span class="material">latten</span>. This matter contains a lot of <span class="material">calamine</span> like all kind of yellow <span class="material">latten</span>, and make a lot of smoke which prevent <span class="material">latten</span> from running, and make it porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten must be as white as water, or as melted <span class="material">silver</span> or as a polished mirror of steel. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated <span class="material">calamine</span> does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second [casting] will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of <span class="material">calamine</span>. If you add <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span> to your <span class="material">latten</span>, this latten will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with <span class="material">huile tingente</span>. Do not use another <span class="material">sand</span> than the above mentioned to mold a <span class="material">noyau</span>, and the mold must become red—hot, like a mold to cast <span class="material">gold</span>. Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow <span class="material">latten</span> with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke.

>  This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the calamine. Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with silver. Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when casting glass. <span class="profession">Foundry workers</span> do not usually use this very yellow latten as much because of the calamine which is heated. They cast red <span class="material">copper</span> and turn it yellow with fresh <span class="material">calamine</span>, or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it with <span class="material">charcoal</span> with a quere made of <span class="material">copper</span> or <span class="material">iron</span>. Then cover it with a cloth soaked in <span class="material">lard</span> blended with <span class="material">saltpetre</span>, or <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>, in order to protect it from wind, which would cool it down.
