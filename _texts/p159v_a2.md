## Carnation

 
Mold a carnation like a <span class="material">rose</span>, <span class="material">marigold</span>, and all other <span class="material">flowers</span> as discussed, that is to say cast the <span class="material">flowers</span> in one mold, and the <span class="material">leaves</span> in two parts in order to solder them onto the <span class="material">flower</span>, this is the better way. But you could <span class="material">mold</span> the flower and the leaves together in one single closed mold. I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the sand must be very thin, and you must blow very strongly.
