## White bronzing on plaster

 
One must apply four layers of <span class="material">painters' distemper glue</span> onto the <span class="material">plaster</span> portrait, leaving one layer to dry at a time. Then apply gently some <span class="material">burnt English point</span> ground on a <span class="tool">marble slab</span>, or some <span class="tool">lead burnt</span>, ground and distempered with a bit of <span class="material">gum</span> or <span class="material">glue</span>. When dry, rub gently with a little <span class="tool">cotton</span> and the plaster portrait will look like <span class="material">lead</span>. Others grind <span class="material">minium</span> with <span class="material">quicksilver</span>.
