## Imitation <span class="material">coral</span>

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  \+ One must first make the <span class="material_format">branches from <span class="material">wood</span></span> or take a <span class="material_format">fantastical <span class="plant">thorn</span> branch</span>, then melt a <span class="unit">pound</span> of the <span class="material_format">best possible clear <span class="material">pine resin</span></span> and add one <span class="unit">ounce</span> of <span class="material_format">finely ground <span class="material">vermilion</span></span> together with <span class="material">walnut oil</span>, and if you add a little <span class="material">Venice lake</span> the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the <span class="material">resin</span>, molten over a <span class="tool">charcoal fire</span>, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your <span class="material">branches</span> with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <span class="material">charcoal</span>.

> <span class="material">Colophony</span> is nothing other than <span class="material">resin</span> that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a <span class="material_format"><span class="material">lead</span>ed pot</span> and melt the <span class="material">resin</span>, boiling it over the <span class="tool">brazier</span> for a good <span class="time">hour</span> until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like <span class="material">water</span> and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a <span class="tool">stick</span>, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a <span class="material">coarse canvas</span> or <span class="material">tammy cloth</span> so that it falls into the <span class="material_format">strongest <span class="material">vinegar</span> you can find</span>, because the <span class="material">vinegar</span> makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your <span class="material">coral</span>, you can mix a <span class="unit">fourth part</span> of <span class="material">mastic</span> with your <span class="material_format">purified <span class="material">resin</span></span> to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one <span class="unit">drop</span> of <span class="material">mastic</span>, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.

> It is made like <span class="material">cement</span>, which is stronger when mixed with <span class="material">crushed glass</span> rather than with <span class="material">brick</span>. In the same way, together with the <span class="material">vermilion</span>, one mixes in <span class="material_format"><span class="material">opaque red enamel</span>, finely ground</span>. It is the same way with all <span class="material">enamel colors</span>.

> <span class="material">Sulfur</span> and <span class="material">vermilion</span> have the same effect.
