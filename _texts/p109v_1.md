## <span class="animal">Toad</span>

 
If by chance you want to mold this ugly animal and if it should piss in your hand, it will sting your hand and cause it to itch, as if you had been holding nettles. But the very best remedy for this is to put your hand into <span class="material">fresh dirt</span>, and to cover it as if you wanted to bury it. <span class="animal">Frogs</span> are not so beautiful when molded because they have shiny skin, and <span class="animal">toads</span> have lumpy skin.

>  You can mold the <span class="animal">toad</span> hollow, and leaving a notch open on the underbelly, you will make it jump with the twisted cord of the saw. If it is a small, put it on a <span class="tool">magnet</span> cut small to the size of the <span class="animal">toad</span>, then put it in good <span class="material">vinegar</span>.

>  If it is big, mold hollow, and if you want to mold it with its mouth open, put some <span class="material">cotton</span> therein, and then put some melted <span class="material">wax</span> on the <span class="material">cotton</span>.
