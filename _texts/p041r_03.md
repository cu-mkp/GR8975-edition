## Sand

 
The <span class="material">sand</span> to be used for casting should be chosen such that it is not too dry for it won't hold together, nor should it be too fat. And although you find some in nature, however, it is not everywhere. And if you are in a place where it is not found, you can put it together yourself but not from <span class="material">fat earth</span>, because the sand should contain none at all, since it makes it porous. But you can make it bind by mixing it with <span class="material">brick</span> well ground on <span class="material">marble</span>, or <span class="material">plaster</span> or <span class="material">calcinated alabaster</span> or something similar, or the burned <span class="material">marrow</span> of ox horn or burned <span class="material">asphalt</span>. If you grind it quite finely on <span class="tool">porphyry</span>, it binds better & then you can burn it with asphalt or mix it with a quarter of <span class="material">tripoli</span>. Make sure no bread falls into your sand because this makes it porous.
