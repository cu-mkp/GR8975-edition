## Colors for green leafs

 
 One usually paints them with <span class="material">oil colors</span>, because distemper colors do not stay on. For <span class="material">marigold flowers</span>, lightly ground <span class="material">minium</span> for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of <span class="material">massicot</span>. For <span class="color">green</span>, the <span class="material">vert—de—gris</span> is dark and too somber. If it is a <span class="color">yellowish—green</span>, you can mix with the <span class="material">vert—de—gris</span> a bit of <span class="color">yellow ochre</span> and <span class="color">scudegrum</span>. If the <span class="color">green</span> is dark, mix in some <span class="material">coals</span> made from peach pits, which makes a <span class="color">greenish—black</span>, in the same way than the <span class="material">bone of an ox foot</span> bone makes a <span class="color">bluish—black</span>. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the <span class="material">natural flower</span> or <span class="material">leaf</span> to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.
