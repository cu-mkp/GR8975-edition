## Colors for green leafs

 
One usually paints them with <span class="material">oil colors</span>, because distemper colors do not stay on. For <span class="material">marigold flowers</span>, lightly ground <span class="material">minium</span> for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of <span class="material">massicot</span>. For green, the <span class="material">vert—de—gris</span> is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish—green, you can mix with the <span class="material">vert—de—gris</span> a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish—black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish—black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.
