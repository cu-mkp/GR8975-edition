## Molding en noyau. Mixing of sand

 
Once you have reheated your <span class="material">sand</span>, that is the <span class="material">plaster</span>, the <span class="material">stone alum</span> and the <span class="material">brick</span>, and once you have finely filtered them through a <span class="tool">cloth sieve</span>, # mix them the following way: take four measures of <span class="material">plaster</span>, two measures of <span class="material">bricks</span>, and one measure of <span class="material">stone alum</span>. Mix them all together with the hands, so that one may not discern one [ingredient] from the other. Once your <span class="material">sand</span> is ready, you need to kill the <span class="animal">animal</span> that you wish to mold in this way.
