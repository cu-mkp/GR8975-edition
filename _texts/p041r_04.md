## Ducks

 
Young domestic ones do not grow for a month after hatching but remain in this state. But after, they soon grow up, even if they go into the water. They are fed boiled <span class="material">millet grains</span>, to which are added crumbled <span class="material">bread</span> and finely chopped <span class="material">lettuce</span>.
