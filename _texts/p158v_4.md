## casts

 
If the <span class="material">medal</span> is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the <span class="material">medal</span>. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.

> Never forget to oil the cast with wax when you cast herbs or flowers, otherwise it will break and cannot be taken out.
