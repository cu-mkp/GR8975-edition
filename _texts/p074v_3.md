## Recipe for white gum

 
Take <span class="material">white wax</span> and <span class="material">ceruse</span> and a little fine <span class="material">pitch</span>, very well pounded together, and put it in a small new <span class="tool">pot</span> and make it melt. And when it will be melted you will make a palette of wood and burnish what you want.
