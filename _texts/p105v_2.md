## Fountain

 
<span class="activity"></span>Recooked <span class="material">plaster</span> runs when mixed with <span class="material">water</span>, which you will see in the next recipe about wet molds. When put on the joints of the fountain conduits, it resists as much as any <span class="material">stucco</span>.
