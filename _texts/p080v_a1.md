## Founders of small <span class="material">tin</span> work

 
 They usually cast from soft <span class="material">solder</span> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and <span class="material">soft tin</span>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include <span class="material">glass tin</span> in them, just like they mix a little <span class="sup"><span class="material">glass tin</span></span> in the <span class="material">soft tin</span>. They carve their work on <span class="material">stones</span> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the <span class="place">mountains</span>, and resemble <span class="material">slate</span>. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; <span class="sup">another</span> one is the color of dark <span class="material">slate</span>, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on <span class="material">carton</span>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their <span class="material">stones</span> and rubbing them together , they use a <span class="tool">compass</span> or <span class="tool">little iron tools</span> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <span class="material">stones</span>, to make a circle or a square with the <span class="material">stones</span> which join perfectly because the <span class="material">stones</span> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <span class="material">tallow</span>, and it <span class="sup">the mould</span> absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having <span class="sup">put</span> fine powder of <span class="material">quicklime</span> into a <span class="tool">cloth</span>, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the <span class="material">linen</span> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles <span class="sup">from forming</span>. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown <span class="sup">on the picture</span>. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the <span class="material">medal</span>. 
 <span class="figure"></span> 
And if they want their work to last, they pierce <span class="sup">it</span> somewhere and fit in a piece of <span class="material">cork</span>. <span class="material">Lead</span> or <span class="material">tin</span> will not damage it.

>  Make sure the <span class="tool">pegs</span> of your frame fit in easily so it will open with ease without moving anything else. Your box molds should fit well, and the table should be very flat.
