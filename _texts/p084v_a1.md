## <span class="material">Sand</span>

 
  I tried the <span class="material">hoof of an ox</span>, quite burned, pulverized and very well crushed on <span class="tool">porphyry</span>, until it is fine enough to slip through your fingers without being felt. On its own, it makes a very clean mold. But because on its own it is very dry and lean, it demands to be well wet and humidified, with a <span class="material">thick broth</span> with <span class="material">elm root</span>. 
 
  <span class="material">Dross of Iron</span>, very burned <span class="material">ox hoof</span>, and felt, all burn well in a closed fire. All three ground very finely on <span class="tool">porphyry</span> mold very neatly in lead, without any need to reheat it much, and by casting in a box mold either hot or cold. 
 
  Felt on its own provides a very clean mold if wet, and comes off easily. And also makes the other two come off easily
