## To varnish

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  <span class="material">Turpentine varnish</span> does not need any <span class="material">glue</span> since it is fat and viscous and does not penetrate the <span class="material">wood</span> as <span class="material_format"><span class="material">spike lavender</span> varnish</span> and <span class="material_format"><span class="material">sandarac</span> varnish</span> would. <span class="material_format"><span class="material">Spike lavender</span> varnish</span> does not require any <span class="material">glue</span> on <span class="material">iron</span> and similar materials which cannot be permeated, but on <span class="material">wood</span> and on <span class="material">colors</span> which do not contain <span class="material">gum</span> or <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle de détrempe</span></span>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said <span class="material">glue <span class="foreign">colle de retailles</span></span> and allow to dry, then varnish.
