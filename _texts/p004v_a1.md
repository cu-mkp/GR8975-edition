## Black varnish for sword guards, metal bands for chests, etc.

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  Take <span class="material">linseed oil</span> or, for a cheaper option, <span class="material">walnut oil</span>, and rid it of fat with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">garlic</span> cloves</span> and <span class="material">hog's fennel</span> (some also add <span class="material_format"><span class="material">bread</span> crusts</span>), which you will boil in it for <span class="time">a good quarter of an hour</span>. Then add to <span class="unit">one pound</span> of the <span class="material">oil</span> boiled in this way a piece of <span class="material">black pitch</span> <span class="unit">the size of a walnut</span> and <span class="unit">a double handful</span> of <span class="material">wheat</span>, without removing the <span class="material">garlic</span> and <span class="material">onions</span>, and allow to boil together for <span class="time">a good quarter of an hour</span>. Once the <span class="material">pitch</span> is well melted and the <span class="material">oil</span> takes on body, you can remove it from the <span class="tool">fire</span>. Then, to varnish, place your <span class="material">iron</span> over a <span class="tool">warm charcoal fire</span> and apply with a <span class="tool">feather</span> or a <span class="tool">brush</span>. When you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your varnish is dry.

>  For an excellent black varnish, add <span class="unit">two or three</span> <span class="material">paternoster beads</span> to the rest.

>  Some consider <span class="material">walnut oil</span> to be better.

>  If there is a quantity of varnish, it needs to boil for <span class="time">at least half a day</span>, because the more it boils, the better it is. Should the varnish boil over, it is dangerous for it to catch fire and it is difficult to extinguish. So do this in a courtyard or other open space.

>  In <span class="unit">five or six lbs.</span> of <span class="material">oil</span>, one must put <span class="unit">one lb.</span> of <span class="material">galipot</span>, which costs 4 sols, and some <span class="material_format">peeled <span class="material">garlic</span> cloves</span>. This varnish is not black in and of itself, but turns black when exposed to <span class="tool">fire</span>.
