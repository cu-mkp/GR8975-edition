## To recognize <span class="material_format">good <span class="material">azur</span> dust</span> for <span class="material">oil</span>

 
The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is finer. Also the one that is also <span class="color">very pale in color</span>, because <span class="material">oil</span> darkens it. Certain <span class="profession">sophists</span> mix them together, but you will find this out if you pour some onto <span class="material_format">a piece of <span class="material">paper</span></span> and lay it flat and spread it with your <span class="tool">finger</span> since, if it is mixed, it will be found varied and so to say with light and darker stripes, but if it is whole it will be even and of one color.
