##  <span class="tool">Brushes</span> 

 
When the color has dried inside them and you want to clean them soak them in some <span class="material">spike lavender oil</span> and they will turn immediately soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some <span class="material">nut oil</span>. <span class="material">Nut oil</span>is not as appropriate to soften them as the <span class="material">spike lavender</span> one which is clear like water and penetrates and is not as thick as the <span class="material">nut oil</span>. Brush handles are made by those who work with care from porcupine hairs, by some others from fine branches of Turkish <span class="material">wood</span> with which they also make small sticks to rest their hand when they are painting

<span class="material">Lake and white lead</span> and <span class="material">ceruse</span> are easy to work with some <span class="material">oil</span>, but every kind of <span class="material">azure</span> is difficult. And to make a beautiful <span class="material">azure</span>, one has to lay it not with big strokes of the brush but with fine strokes of the end. Not only for <span class="material">azurite ash</span> and <span class="material">azur</span> from <span class="place">Acre</span> but mainly for <span class="material">enamel azur</span> which has to be very fine, otherwise you will not be able to work with it unless with hard work and you have to mingle it with some <span class="material">turpentine</span> to thicken it and and to mingle it with some <span class="material">white lead</span>. Any <span class="material">azure</span> must not neither be ground nor washed for it loses its color and become pale. But put some of it powdered on your palette and you moisten it bit by bit with some <span class="material">nut oil</span> or <span class="material">turpentine</span>, dip a knife point in some <span class="material">oil</span> and then mix it bit by bit on the said palette
