## Crayfish

 
The <span class="material">hairy little horns</span> that the <span class="material">crayfish</span> has under its snout tend to come out lumpy and unclear because, after they are burnt, it is difficult to remove and clean away their ash, which, staying in the mold, prevents the metal from running well. And for this reason, one makes a small gate of <span class="material">wax thread</span> at the tips of them, in order both to hold them up and to blow away the cumbersome ashes from inside.

> Do not spare any <span class="material">pins</span>, placing them not only in the middle of the body, but also on the big legs, and two or three on the tail, according to the positioning that you want to give it.
