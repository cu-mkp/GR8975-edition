## To make <span class="material">vermillion</span>

 
Take two pounds of <span class="material">sulphur</span>, and melt it, and add two pounds of <span class="material">mercury</span> to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the <span class="tool">pot</span>, then put everything for some time after into a <span class="tool">leaded pot</span>, into the fire. In the space of twenty—four hours, you will have good <span class="material">vermillion</span>.
