## Tempering bullets to pierce bullet—proof armor

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Heat the <span class="material_format"><span class="material">lead</span> bullet</span> as much as you can without melting it, and once it is hot dip it into <span class="material_format">the strongest <span class="material">vinegar</span></span> that you can. And do this four or five times. Afterwards, mince some <span class="material">lard</span> very finely and some <span class="material">linen</span> also very delicately, mix all this together and use it as wadding, making it go into the arquebus or pistol with a little strength and very tightly. And before shooting, if possible, the bullet should be hot.
