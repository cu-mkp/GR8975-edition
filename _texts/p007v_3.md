## To relieve the pain of g{out}

 
   Take half a pound of finely powdered golden and yellow marcasite, half an ounce of storax, 4 lb. of urine, incorporate well together, little by little, in a mortar, then boil all together quite strongly. But the pot needs to be well covered so the smoke does not escape. Then distill the imbibed urine, separated by inclination, in an alembic, well luted and covered with a copper head. And soak a cloth with the said water and apply it lukewarm on the pain.
