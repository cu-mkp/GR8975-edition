## <span class="material">Glass</span> <span class="tool">vessel</span>

 
<span class="activity"></span>The <span class="material">glass</span> <span class="tool">vessel</span> must be either pear—shaped or round pyramid—shaped, of the same thickness as the small back of a <span class="tool">knife</span>, round on the bottom without folding over on itself, like <span class="tool">flasks</span>, its opening of such a size that a <span class="foreign">Dutch</span> <span class="material">feather</span>can just about get in, with a lip at the end, in this way of the height of seven <span class="unit">fingers' width</span>.
