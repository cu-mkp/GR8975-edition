## Casting

 
<span class="activity"></span><span class="material">Tin</span> recoils if thick, therefore it is better to cast it thin and from one piece, to make two and then solder them together, if necessary. One makes use of a strong piece of <span class="material"><span class="tool">taffeta</span></span> to sieve the <span class="material">fine sand</span> with which one first covers the medal, which is of the thickness of a teston.
