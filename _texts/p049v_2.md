## Grain of lead

 
*position: middle*

Take a playing card, pierced with a pin or needle, folded over on all four sides. Hold it with the end of a small split stick and, holding said stick by the other end, put your card three or 4 fingers away from the water that you will have put in a platter or a similar vessel. Then pour your lead, which should not be too hot, into the card and continually tap on the stick that holds it. And thus your lead will turn into round grains. And pass it through a large sieve to separate the larger grain from the smaller. The larger one will carry 25 to 30 paces.
