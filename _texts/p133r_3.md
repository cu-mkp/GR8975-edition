## Marks [made by] the [pin] points of iron thread which one finds on the head of an animal

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 With the <span class="material">points</span> [or <span class="material">pins</span>] with which you have dressed [your animal] all over, do same with the head, but [out of] the head which is pierced, a certain moisture seeps out around the wound and this little exudation prevents the <span class="material">sand</span> from covering the point well and there always remain little pinpricks. But to avoid this, you can plant in the plaster of the said blunt pin point and around the upper part of the point, and over this point, there put a little hard <span class="material">wax</span> or a little <span class="material">mastic</span> or <span class="material">cement</span>. And by the medium of the hot <span class="tool">thread of iron</span> there you can hold the throat of the animal which one removes [the iron] when you come to uncover the vents and the throat for doing the second cast.
