## Chassis used by Germans

 
Germans who work in small scale make 'chassis" not of <span class="material">glass</span> but of <span class="tool">canvas</span> oiled with clear <span class="material">turpentine varnish</span>, that is half of <span class="material">turpentine oil</span> and almost half of <span class="material">turpentine</span>, because such light, being less bright than glass, makes the lines appear thicker. And when they want to make something more delicate, such as veins and similar things, they use <span class="tool">brushes</span> made of two or three <span class="material">rat hairs</span>.
