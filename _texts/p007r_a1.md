##  To gild with gold color and tinsel 

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Once you have colored or made your <span class="ref">stamped ornament in tin</span> (as previously described), or in <span class="material">iron</span> or <span class="material">copper</span>, you must not put <span class="material">glue</span> as on <span class="material">wood</span>, but just have some <span class="ref">fatty oil</span>, <span class="sub_recipe">which is made in seven or eight days in the <span class="tool">sun</span> from <span class="material">walnut oil</span> and <span class="material">white lead</span>, stirring often, or cooked on <span class="tool">fire</span> if one should be in hurry</span>. Then, with <span class="ref"> the oil thus made fatty</span>, grind a little <span class="material">white lead</span>, <span class="material">massicot</span> and <span class="material">black graphite</span>, at discretion, <span class="unit">as much of one as of the other</span>. <span class="material">Minium</span> will color the <span class="material">gold</span>. Then apply an even layer of that onto your <span class="ref">stamp</span>, taking care you do not fill the hollows. And once it is almost dry, apply the <span class="material_format"><span class="material">gold</span> leaf</span> on it using <span class="tool"><span class="material">cotton</span></span>. Such <span class="material">gold</span> will withstand rain on houses or elsewhere. And if you have made your <span class="material">gilt</span> with <span class="material">tinsel</span>, color it with <span class="material_format"><span class="material">smoke</span> from a partridge or from yellow or red <span class="material">cloth</span></span>, and it will look as fine as pure <span class="material">gold</span>. You can cover trunks, mirrors, bed valances and posts in colored <span class="material">velvet</span> or <span class="material">satin</span> and then apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with strong <span class="material">glue</span>.
