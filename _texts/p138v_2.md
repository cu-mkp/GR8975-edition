## <span class="material">Gold</span> casted very thinly

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 When <span class="profession">goldsmiths</span> have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it, they melt <span class="material">gold</span> and then they pour it on a <span class="tool">cloth</span> or on anything else that withstands fire. Then they flatten it swiftly with a <span class="tool">hammer</span> or another similar tool, and it [the gold] is very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth. 
 
 Unalloyed pure <span class="material">gold</span> can be cast into a medal but not into <span class="plant">herbs</span> and <span class="animal">lizards</span> or other very delicate things if it is not alloyed. 
 
 A <span class="plant">pansy</span> which is oiled with <span class="material">wheat oil</span> can be cast with alloyed <span class="material">gold</span>. 
 
 And other <span class="plant">fruit leaves</span>, but with branch[es] that are not large and especially the leaves, once cast, can be soldered.
