##  <span class="material">Talcum</span> mixed with the molds 

 
 I used the one from which I had extracted the <span class="material">oil</span>. I crushed it very finely even more into a <span class="material">steel</span> mortar with a <span class="tool">pestle</span> [which was] rough like a file. I crushed it very finely into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the sand and soaked both matters together, and I casted it en <span class="material">noyau</span>. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand fire.
