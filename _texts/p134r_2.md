## <span class="material">Sand</span> made of <span class="material">crocum [ferri]</span>

 
 You can use the mixture made of <span class="material">crocum ferri</span> to cast <span class="material">silver</span> or <span class="material">gold</span>, this mixture will make these casts firm, and prevent these from cracking and making burrs. And I believe that for flat things, it would withstand severa casts. Which however is not commonly done for <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span>.
