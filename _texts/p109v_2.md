## Killing <span class="animal">snakes</span> for molding

 
Some put a drop of <span class="material">aqua fortis</span> into their mouths, which stupefies them, so that the head and the body look dead. But the head is still alive, and when you stick it with a <span class="tool">needle</span> in order to fix it to your mold, it moves and spoils and undoes everything. Therefore, to kill your <span class="animal">snake</span>, put it into a <span class="tool">bottle</span> filled with good <span class="material">vinegar</span> and some <span class="material">spirits</span>. Do the same with <span class="animal">lizards</span> and other similar animals.

> If you want to keep them, you can put them in a <span class="tool">pipe</span> full of <span class="material">dirt</span> in a garden outdoors, but it is necessary that the <span class="tool">pipe</span> be covered with <span class="material">latten wire</span>, because otherwise, the <span class="animal">snakes</span> will crawl and climb up quite high.
