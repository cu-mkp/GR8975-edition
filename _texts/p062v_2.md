## Perspective

 
In order to tell where the vanishing point is one must lay a <span class="tool">ruler</span> over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their <span class="tool">rulers</span> in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the <span class="tool">ruler</span> about. Others lay a <span class="tool">ruler</span> across the <span class="tool">panel</span>,, then on this ruler they place the tip of another <span class="tool">ruler</span> which, being attached to the former by a <span class="tool">screw</span>, will move about and reach as far as necessary without losing the point. The <span class="tool">ruler</span> and <span class="tool">compass</span> without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

> To paint a perspective in <span class="material">oil</span>, you should not use a <span class="tool">ruler</span>, for you would smudge everything. Instead, in applying your colors you must keep and follow the lines of your first drawing.
