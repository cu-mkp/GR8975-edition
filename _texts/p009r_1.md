##  <span class="profession">Plowman</span> 

 
 <span class="activity"></span> Since <span class="material"><span class="plant">millet</span></span> is naturally very dry, <span class="profession">harvesters</span> thresh it most often in the cool of <span class="time">night</span> and in moonlight. Which could not be done with another, wetter, grain, because you must let the <span class="tool">sunbeams</span> pass over it, and one rarely threshes it before <span class="time">midday</span>. Immediately after the <span class="material"><span class="plant">millet</span></span> is harvested, the earth needs to be plowed because its roots eat and make lean the soil as much as if the <span class="material"><span class="plant">millet</span></span> was still standing. The ground where <span class="material"><span class="plant">millet</span></span> will have been sown becomes quite diminished in fertility, which you can tell next time it is sown. But more than any other the grain called <span class="material"><span class="plant"><span class="foreign">pomole</span></span></span> in <span class="place">Gasconyor</span> or <span class="material"><span class="plant"><span class="foreign">baillard</span></span></span> in northern <span class="place">France</span>, makes the earth shake, according to the common saying, seven years later. <span class="plant">Broad beans</span> improve and enrich the soil, provided that one lets the roots and stems rot in it.
