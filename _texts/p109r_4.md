## Forge <span class="tool">bellows</span>

 
It is better that at the end with the air chamber the bellows be set in some kind of bit of cloven board because they are more secure this way. Afterwards you can lightly secure them from the top. It is necessary that the nozzles be four <span class="unit">fingers</span> above the bottom of the forge.
